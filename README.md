# Algorithmic Complexity

This is a node.js app which tests the time complexity of various algorithms, matching them with the relevent Big O notation.

I will be writing my own procedures, and comparing their complexity to built in Javascript procedures.

My attempt will be in the `myAttempt.js` file within a given directory, and each directory will be a new procedure.
